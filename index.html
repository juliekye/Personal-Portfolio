        > <strong>Hello there! Welcome to my portfolio,</strong> I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at Arizona
        State University.
        <br> > I am an eager learner who is always looking for new opportunities to advance my skills in software
        engineering. I am passionate about Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures & Algorithms, and Web
        Development.
        My favorite programming languages are Java and C++, although I am also experienced in Python, HTML, CSS, and a
        little bit of JavaScript.
        <br> > Outside of my educational and career pursuits I am an avid traveler, Pokemon enthusiast, and rock
        collecter!
        <br> > If you would like to learn more about my relevant skills, experience, and personal projects regarding
        software development, please visit the following pages:

        <strong class="subtitle"> DIJKSTRA'S SHORTEST PATH BETWEEN CITIES BY TRAIN</strong>
        <br>
        > This C++ program demonstrates Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm by taking inputs of departure cities and the
        distances to each of its arrival cities.
        <br>
        > One source city must be specified by the user. The shortest paths from the source city to all reachable
        arrival cities is then computed by considering all paths of connecting routes.

        > The purpose for building this portfolio was not only to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but
        also to introduce myself as a programmer in a unique way. I personally enjoy learning through creating and this
        was a fun way to display my skills and customize the website to my liking.

        <strong class="subtitle">WORK EXPERIENCE:</strong> UNDERGRADUATE TEACHING ASSISTANT
        <br>
        > As a UGTA for Data Structures & Algorithms, I primarily assisted in helping students with programming
        assignments in C++. I was also responsible for holding exam review sessions and creating supplementary videos
        for difficult topics from the course. This experience solidified my knowledge on acquiring time complexities for
        algorithms to determine efficiency as well as implementing them with appropriate data structures. Other valuable
        skills I gained through this was competency in teaching and increased profficiency C++.
