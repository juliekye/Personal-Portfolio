      > Hello there! Welcome to my portfolio, I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at Arizona State University. 
      <br> > I am an eager learner who is always looking for new opportunities to advance my skills in software engineering. I am passionate about Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures & Algorithms, and Web Development. My favorite programming languages are Java and C++, although I am also experienced in Python, HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. 
      <br> > Outside of my educational and career pursuits I am an avid traveler, pokemon enthusiast, and rock collecter!
      <br> > If you would like to learn more about my relevant skills, experience, and personal projects regarding software development, please visit the following pages:

      DIJKSTRA'S SHORTEST PATH BETWEEN CITIES BY TRAIN
      <br>
      <br>
      > This C++ program demonstrates Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm by taking inputs of departure cities and the distances to each of its arrival cities. 
      <br>
      > One source city must be specified by the user. The shortest paths from the source city to all reachable arrival cities is then computed by considering all paths of connecting routes.

  WORK EXPERIENCE: UNDERGRADUATE TEACHING ASSISTANT
  <br>
    <br>
    > As a UGTA for Data Structures & Algorithms, I primarily assisted in helping students with programming assignments in C++. I was also responsible for holding exam review sessions and creating supplementary videos for difficult topics from the course. This experience solidified my knowledge on acquiring time complexities for algorithms to determine efficiency as well as implementing them with appropriate data structures. Other valuable skills I gained through this was competency in teaching and increased profficiency C++.
