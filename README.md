# Personal-Portfolio
Personal Portfolio built using HTML, styled with CSS, and animation in JavaScript.  

This personalized website was created to showcase Web Development skills while introducing myself as a programmer. 
The first page describes the purpose of this website and its contents. 
The following page contains my personal projects and the last page presents my work experience and extra curriculars related to computer science.
At the bottom of the window at all times are links to connect with me.

The matrix themed animation is inspired by ["Matrix Rain Animation"](https://codepen.io/yaclive/pen/EayLYO), the code for this is the matrix.js file. The blinking cursor on the first page is animated in JavaScript in the cursor.js file.
The index.html file is the primary file for this website where content is written and formatted. Here, links to external websites and different pages within the website are imported. 
All of the written content is customized in the CSS file style.css. Fonts VT232 and Quantico were used from https://fonts.google.com in order to acheive the
overall design for the website. The PNG images for the contact links are stored in the image folder.
