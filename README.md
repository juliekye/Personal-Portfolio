# Personal-Portfolio
Personal Portfolio built using HTML, styled with CSS, and animation in JavaScript.  

This personalized website was created to showcase Web Development skills while introducing myself as a programmer. 
The first page describes the purpose of this website and its contents. 
The following page contains my personal projects and the last page presents my skills and experience in software engineering.
At the bottom of the window at all times are links to connect with me.
The matrix themed animation is done in JavaScript, the code for this is the matrix.js file. The blinking cursor on the first page is animated in JavaScript in the cursor.js file.
The index.html file is the primary file for this website where content is written and formatted. Here, links to external websites and different pages within the website are imported. 
All of the written content is customized in the CSS file style.css. Varieties of fonts were used referenced from [Google fonts] (https://fonts.google.com) in order to acheive the
overall design for the website. The images for the contact links are stored in the image folder.
